## ðŸš€ About Me
![hi! I am Dominik Calak](https://github.com/DominikCLK/cypress-project/assets/75272795/ae9eddd4-9083-4a09-98ea-e1a0b9c3c87b)

I started gaining my experience from 2020 by taking a course in software testing. Then I expanded my knowledge with automation tests, I learned frameworks such as Cypress, Playwright.

I have been working at Maandag Poland as a Software Tester since March 2022. At work, I use tools such as VS Code, Azure DevOps, Playwright and Postman. Working as a tester gives me joy and satisfaction, so I would like to constantly develop and have high-level skills.
