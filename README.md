## 🚀 About Me
I started gaining my experience from 2020 by taking a course in software testing. Then I expanded my knowledge with automation tests, I learned frameworks such as Cypress, Playwright or WebdriverIO.
I have been working at WhooHoo Poland as a Software Tester since 2022. At work, I use tools such as VS Code, Azure DevOps, WebdriverIO, Playwright and Postman. Working as a tester gives me joy and satisfaction, so I would like to constantly develop and have high-level skills.
After work, I spend my time exercising at the gym or learning from various online courses
