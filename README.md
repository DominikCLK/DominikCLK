## 🚀 About Me
I am a young man with very set goals, so I decided to take fate into my own hands to get them. I completed a six-month testing course, where I gained theoretical and practical knowledge. During the course, I learned the basics of testing theory and testing techniques. The practical part included test management, bug reporting and reporting, writing test cases and automation scripts in Cypress.

My next step in the near future is to acquire knowledge and skills in SQL and API, implementation of my own projects in the field of functional or performance tests, implementation of projects on the UTest platform.
There are many goals and even more ambitions. I look forward to a new opportunity to grow and build a career path in IT.
